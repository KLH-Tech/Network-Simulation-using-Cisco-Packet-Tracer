# Network-Simulation-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This Project will be dealing with the Configuration of various components of a WAN (wide area network ) . Such as  Connections between working Routers , Switches and Servers across the large coverage area under its range.
By using the CISCO tool we simulate complex scenarios on packet tracer and understand the real world applications of the network Layout with its networking Devices .
