# Network-Simulation-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This Project will be dealing with the Configuration of various components of a WAN (wide area network ) . Such as  Connections between working Routers , Switches and Servers across the large coverage area under its range.
By using the CISCO tool we simulate complex scenarios on packet tracer and understand the real world applications of the network Layout with its networking Devices .
The Real-Time or Simulation Mode is used to create network topologies and to simulate processes inside the created topology. The real-time mode simulates a real environment, with the same speed of simulated networks and protocols as in real situations. If some operation for a simulated protocol in Packet Tracer in the real world takes 30 seconds, it takes a similar time also in the Packet Tracer simulation.
